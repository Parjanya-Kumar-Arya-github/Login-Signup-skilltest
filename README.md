This is a simple website with next js. I made this as a skillTest.
Just clone the repository and type npm run dev in your terminal with this repository as the root directory and the site will run on your local host or you can check out the website on this link: [The site!](https://login-signup-skilltest.vercel.app/)
There is also the app version of this site [Download the android app from here!](https://github.com/Parjanya-Kumar-Arya-github/Login-Signup-skilltest/blob/main/skill_test-for-login_signup.apk)
and also an IOS version and open this only on your simulator as this isn't signed and apple doesn't allow to install any third party app directly [Download the ios app from here!](https://github.com/Parjanya-Kumar-Arya-github/Login-Signup-skilltest/blob/main/skill_test_login_signup_for_ios_simulator.gz)

Note: This is only the design so it doesn't have to do anything with backend.
